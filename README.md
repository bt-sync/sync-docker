## Resilio Sync

https://www.resilio.com

Sync uses peer-to-peer technology to provide fast, private file sharing for teams and individuals. By skipping the cloud, transfers can be significantly faster because files take the shortest path between devices. Sync does not store your information on servers in the cloud, avoiding cloud privacy concerns.

### Usage

```
DATA_FOLDER=/path/to/data/folder/on/the/host
WEBUI_PORT=<port to access the webui on the host>

mkdir -p $DATA_FOLDER

docker run -d --name Sync \
           -p 127.0.0.1:$WEBUI_PORT:8888 \
           -p 55555 \
           -v $DATA_FOLDER:/mnt/sync \
           --restart on-failure \
           resilio/sync
```

Be sure to always run docker container with `--restart` parameter to allow Docker daemon to handle Sync container (launch at startup as well as restart it in case of failure).

Go to `http://localhost:$WEBUI_PORT` in a web browser to access the webui.

If you need to run Sync under specific user inside your container - use `--user` [parameter](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#user).

### Volume

* `/mnt/sync` - folder inside the container that contains the [storage folder](https://help.resilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206664690-Sync-Storage-folder), [configuration file](https://help.resilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206178884) and default download folder

### Ports

* `8888` - Webui port
* `55555` - Listening port for Sync traffic (you can change it, but in this case change it in Sync [settings](https://help.resilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204762669-Sync-Preferences) as well)

#### LAN access

If you do not want to limit the access to the webui, do not specify localhost address in `-p` parameter:

```
docker run -d --name Sync \
           -p $WEBUI_PORT:8888 \
           -p 55555 \
           -v $DATA_FOLDER:/mnt/sync \
           --restart on-failure \
           resilio/sync
```

#### Extra directories

If you need to mount extra directories, mount them in `/mnt/mounted_folders`:

```
docker run -d --name Sync \
           -p 127.0.0.1:$WEBUI_PORT:8888 \
           -p 55555 \
           -v $DATA_FOLDER:/mnt/sync \
           -v <OTHER_DIR>:/mnt/mounted_folders/<DIR_NAME> \
           -v <OTHER_DIR2>:/mnt/mounted_folders/<DIR_NAME2> \
           --restart on-failure \
           resilio/sync
```

Do not create directories at the root of `/mnt/mounted_folders` from the Sync webui since they will not be mounted on the host.
